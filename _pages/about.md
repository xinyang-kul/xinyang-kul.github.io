Hello! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Division of Mechatronic System Dynamics (LMSD) at KU Leuven, under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Chronopoulos](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00144410). Prior to this, I graduated with a Master's degree from the School of Automotive Studies at [Tongji University](https://autoen.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2022. I received my Bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering, with the honor of Excellent Graduate, from [Chongqing University](https://mve.cqu.edu.cn/jxyyzgcywb/Home.htm) in 2019.

My research interests are anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance, with an emphasis on aircraft composite wings and wind turbines. Recently, I have become interested in multisensory and multimodal data fusion, utilizing sensing techniques such as laser Doppler vibrometer, high-speed/thermal cameras, and acoustic emission. 

If you’re interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me and I’d be happy to discuss potential opportunities!
