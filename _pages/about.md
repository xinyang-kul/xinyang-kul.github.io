Hello! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Division of Mechatronic System Dynamics ([LMSD](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/mod)) at KU Leuven, under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Chronopoulos](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00144410) and [Prof. Pradeep Kundu](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00155770). Prior to this, I graduated with a Master's degree from the School of Automotive Studies at [Tongji University](https://autoen.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2022. I received my Bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering, with the honor of Excellent Graduate, from [Chongqing University](https://mve.cqu.edu.cn/jxyyzgcywb/Home.htm) in 2019.

My research interests are anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance, with a focus on <strong>aircraft composite wings and wind turbines</strong>. Recently, I have become interested in <strong>multisensory and multimodal data fusion</strong>, utilizing sensing techniques such as laser Doppler vibrometer, high-speed/thermal cameras, and acoustic emission. 

If you’re interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me and I’d be happy to discuss potential opportunities!
